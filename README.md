# Predicting Online News Popularity
This project aims to predict the popularity of online news stories using different classification algorithms. The analysis will explore the process of building and evaluating Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Artificial Neural Network and Gradient Boosting models.

### Data Set
The data set was provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

### Analysis
The following algorithms will be explored using the H2O package:
1.	Naïve Bayes
2.	Logistic Regression
3.	Random Forest
4.	Artificial Neural Networks
5.	Gradient Boosting

### Files
The project contains the following files:
1.	OnlineNewsPopularity.csv – The dataset
2.	news_analysis.Rmd – R markdown file
3.	news_analysis.nb.html – Interactive HTML Presentation
4.	news_analysis.R – Raw R script
